# Hough_Lines
One of the filter edge detection used to detect lines efficiently.
It detects lines by converting image from image space to hough space.
Intersection of lines in the hough space indicate line in an image.
Here it clearly detects the the screen of mobile.


By changing the values of the threshold we can see what other lines it detects. 
By decreasing threshhold a little, we will see the lines along the apps also.
